  abstract = {In patients battling cancer, many aspects of antimicrobial treatment become more complex, and standard antimicrobial regimens may be inadequate. Various pathophysiological changes in critically ill patients with cancer significantly affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antimicrobials. In an unacceptably high percentage of these patients, variability of relevant PK parameters results in inadequate antimicrobial drug exposure across all drug classes. The pathogen, with its susceptibility to an antibacterial agent (ie, pharmacodynamics [PD]), is a given; however, drug exposure (ie, PK) can be influenced by adjusting the dosage regimen. Dosage optimization strategies to improve the probability of attaining the PK/PD target and, thus, achieve clinical success are a key area of current translational research. An intensified focus on dosage regimens targeted at bacterial killing of both the fully susceptible bacterial population and resistant mutants may prevent emergence of resistance while also better meeting the needs of this substantial patient population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus is the most common cause of adult meningitis in Africa. We assessed the safety and microbiological efficacy of adjunctive sertraline, previously shown to have in-vitro and in-vivo activity against cryptococcus. METHODS: In this open-label dose-finding study, we recruited HIV-infected individuals with cryptococcal meningitis who presented to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda between Aug 14, 2013, and Aug 30, 2014. To assess safety and tolerability, the first 60 participants were given sertraline at escalating doses of 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, 300 mg/day, or 400 mg/day as induction therapy for 2 weeks, followed by consolidation therapy with 200 mg/day for an additional 8 weeks. From Nov 29, 2013, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive open-label sertraline at predetermined doses of 200 mg/day, 300 mg/day, or 400 mg/day as induction therapy for 2 weeks, followed by consolidation therapy with 200 mg/day for 8 weeks. Dose assignment was made via computer-generated, permuted block randomisation stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) status for people with a first episode of meningitis. The primary outcome was 2-week cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearance rate of cryptococcus, termed early fungicidal activity, measured in patients with a first episode of culture-positive meningitis and two or more CSF cultures. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01802385. FINDINGS: Of the 330 individuals assessed, 172 HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis were enrolled. We gave 100 mg/day sertraline to 17 patients, 200 mg/day to 12 patients, 300 mg/day to 14 patients, and 400 mg/day to 17 patients. 112 participants were randomly assigned to receive sertraline at 200 mg (n=48), 300 mg (n=36), or 400 mg (n=28) daily for the first 2 weeks, and 200 mg/day thereafter. The final population consisted of 17 participants in the 100 mg group, 60 in the 200 mg group, 50 in the 300 mg group, and 45 in the 400 mg in group. Participants receiving any sertraline dose averaged a CSF clearance rate of -0{$\cdot$}37 colony forming units per mL per day (95\% CI -0{$\cdot$}41 to -0{$\cdot$}33). Incidence of paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was 5\% (two of 43 newly starting ART) and no cases of relapse occurred over the 12-week study period. 38 (22\%) of 172 participants had died at 2 weeks, and 69 (40\%) had died at 12 weeks. Six grade 4 adverse events occurred in 17 participants receiving 100 mg, 14 events in 60 participants receiving 200 mg, 19 events in 50 participants receiving 300 mg, and eight events in 45 participants receiving 400 mg. Grade 4 or 5 adverse event risk did not differ between current US Food and Drug Administration-approved dosing of 100-200 mg/day and higher doses of 300-400 mg/day (hazard ratio 1{$\cdot$}27, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}69-2{$\cdot$}32; p=0{$\cdot$}45). INTERPRETATION: Participants receiving sertraline had faster cryptococcal CSF clearance and a lower incidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and relapse than that reported in the past. This inexpensive and off-patent oral medication is a promising adjunctive antifungal therapy. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health, Grand Challenges Canada.},

Data sources included MEDLINE (1966-June 2017), EMBASE (1980-June 2017), PubMed (1966-June 2017), Global Health-Ovid (inception to June 2017), LILACS Virtual Health Library (inception to June 2017) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (to 2nd quarter 2017). The ClinicalTrial.gov database, the SCOPUS database, SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature) and Google Scholar were also utilised to search for relevant studies. Randomised studies of any pharmacotherapy of invasive candidiasis including candidemia using a fungicidal (amphotericin B or echinocandin compound) versus a fungistatic (triazole) compound in adolescent or adult non-neutropenic patients. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Pooled odds ratios demonstrated an advantage of fungicidal therapy with respect to early therapeutic success (OR 1.61, 95\% CI 1.27-2.03, p~{$<~$}0.0001, I2~=~0\%) and persistence or recurrence of infection (OR 0.51, 95\% CI 0.35-0.74, p~=~0.0005, I2~=~0\%) but no advantage for late survival (OR 0.97, 95\% CI 0.77-1.21, p~=~0.77, I2~=~0\%). Fungicidal therapy of invasive candidiasis and candidemia is associated with a higher probability of early therapeutic success and decreased probability of persistent or recurrent infection. However, there is no improvement in survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is an important healthcare-related infection, with increasing incidence and a crude mortality exceeding 50\%. Numerous treatment options are available yet comparative studies have not identified optimal therapy. METHODS: We conducted an individual patient-level quantitative review of randomized trials for treatment of IC and to assess the impact of host-, organism-, and treatment-related factors on mortality and clinical cure. Studies were identified by searching computerized databases and queries of experts in the field for randomized trials comparing the effect of {$\geq$}2 antifungals for treatment of IC. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to determine factors associated with patient outcomes. RESULTS: Data from 1915 patients were obtained from 7 trials. Overall mortality among patients in the entire data set was 31.4\%, and the rate of treatment success was 67.4\%. Logistic regression analysis for the aggregate data set identified increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.01; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.02; P = .02), the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (OR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.14; P = .0001), use of immunosuppressive therapy (OR, 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.18-2.44; P = .001), and infection with Candida tropicalis (OR, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.11-2.39; P = .01) as predictors of mortality. Conversely, removal of a central venous catheter (CVC) (OR, 0.50; 95\% CI, .35-.72; P = .0001) and treatment with an echinocandin antifungal (OR, 0.65; 95\% CI, .45-.94; P = .02) were associated with decreased mortality. Similar findings were observed for the clinical success end point. CONCLUSIONS: Two treatment-related factors were associated with improved survival and greater clinical success: use of an echinocandin and removal of the CVC.},

Our prior studies indicate that the matrix is complex, with major polysaccharide constituents being {$\alpha$}-mannan, {$\beta$}-1,6 glucan, and {$\beta$}-1,3 glucan. Here we implement genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches to unravel the contributions of these three constituents to matrix structure and function. Interference with synthesis or export of any one polysaccharide constituent altered matrix concentrations of each of the other polysaccharides. Each of these was also required for matrix function, as assessed by assays for sequestration of the antifungal drug fluconazole. These results indicate that matrix biogenesis entails coordinated delivery of the individual matrix polysaccharides. To understand whether coordination occurs at the cellular level or the community level, we asked whether matrix-defective mutant strains could be coaxed to produce functional matrix through biofilm coculture. We observed that mixed biofilms inoculated with mutants containing a disruption in each polysaccharide pathway had restored mature matrix structure, composition, and biofilm drug resistance. Our results argue that functional matrix biogenesis is coordinated extracellularly and thus reflects the cooperative actions of the biofilm community.},

  abstract = {In healthcare settings, Candida spp. cause invasive disease with high mortality. The overwhelming majority of cases are associated with the use of critically-needed medical devices, such as vascular catheters. On the surface of these indwelling materials, Candida forms resilient, adherent biofilm communities. A hallmark characteristic of this process is the production of an extracellular matrix, which promotes fungal adhesion and provides protection from external threats. In this review, we highlight the medical relevance of device-associated Candida biofilms and draw attention to the process of Candida-biofilm-matrix production. We provide an update on the current understanding of how biofilm extracellular matrix contributes to pathogenicity, particularly through its roles in the promoting antifungal drug tolerance and immune evasion.},

  abstract = {Understanding the tissue penetration of systemically administered antifungal agents is critical for a proper appreciation of their antifungal efficacy in animals and humans. Both the time course of an antifungal drug and its absolute concentrations within tissues may differ significantly from those observed in the bloodstream. In addition, tissue concentrations must also be interpreted within the context of the pathogenesis of the various invasive fungal infections, which differ significantly. There are major technical obstacles to the estimation of concentrations of antifungal agents in various tissue subcompartments, yet these agents, even those within the same class, may exhibit markedly different tissue distributions. This review explores these issues and provides a summary of tissue concentrations of 11 currently licensed systemic antifungal agents. It also explores the therapeutic implications of their distribution at various sites of infection.},

There can be considerable variability in pharmacokinetics, for example, owing to comorbidities or other medications, which affects antimicrobial pharmacodynamics and, thus, treatment success. Although current approaches to antimicrobial dose optimization address fixed variability, better methods to monitor and rapidly adjust antimicrobial dosing are required to understand and react to residual variability that occurs within and between individuals. We review current challenges to the wider implementation of antimicrobial dose optimization and highlight novel solutions, including biosensor-based, real-time therapeutic drug monitoring and computer-controlled, closed-loop control systems. Precision antimicrobial dosing promises to improve patient outcome and is important for antimicrobial stewardship and the prevention of antimicrobial resistance.},
